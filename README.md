For the following project we decided to use [NBA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games) from Kaggle. 
We answered the following research questions: 
1. When a player with the highest points per game (the "star player") doesn't play a game, what effect does that have on the rest of the team?
2. Can we use random forests and logistic regression to predict which team will win out of a certain head to head match up?
3. Can we estimate the win percentage of both home and away teams over several season using a Bayesian Hiearchal Model?

Within this directory we have two files. 
1. NBA Performance Analsis Code - This holds all the code that was used to answer all three questions. This file is extensively documented, allowing for readers to be able to see our thinking process in answering each question.
2. Explanation of Findings for NBA Performance Analysis - This is a pdf document which discusses our findings for each research question.
